# Quiz 1 - P2P and Small World

## The clustering coefficient

```
        2 * e(v)
C(v) =  ----------------
        deg(v)(deg(v)-1)
```

e(v) denotes the number of connections of vâ€™s neighbors that are connected with each other. Which means the number of edges that connect v's neigbors.

```
        2 * 2   4
C(c) =  ----- = --
        4 * 3   12

Calculating e(v) = 2:
1.edge (D,H)
2.edge (H,G)
```

## P2P ISO/OSI model

P2P systems reside on the Layer 7 (Application Layer).

## Number of messages created in a flooding of a request in Gnutella

```
* Gnutella 0.4 system
* N = 11 connections per node
* T = 4 (Time to live)

Number of messages = $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{T-1} N \times (N-1)^i$
```
